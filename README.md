### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Exploration

### Description
In this project, **Python** was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

I used the data provided by `Motivate`, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
The data provided by Motivate:
- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

### Credits
- Thanks to the Udacity team for this wonderful Nanodegree and Access Bank Group for sponsoring this!
